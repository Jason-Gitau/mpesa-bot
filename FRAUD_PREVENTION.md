### Key Protection Features

#### 1. Payment Holding
**How it works:**
- Buyer pays → Funds go to escrow (NOT seller)
- Seller ships → Payment still held
- Buyer confirms → Payment released after 24 hours
- Auto-release → Only after 7 days with no dispute

**Why it prevents fraud:**
- Seller can't run away with money before delivery
- Buyer can inspect item before seller gets paid
- Automatic refunds protect against non-delivery

#### 2. Deadline Enforcement
**How it works:**
- Seller must ship within 2-5 days (listing specific)
- If deadline missed → Automatic full refund
- No excuses, no exceptions

**Why it prevents fraud:**
- Prevents "payment received, never shipped" scams
- Holds sellers accountable to commitments
- Protects buyer time and money

#### 3. Verification Requirements
**How it works:**
- Unverified sellers: Max KES 10,000/transaction
- Verified sellers: Up to KES 500,000/transaction
- Verification requires: ID, phone, address, business docs

**Why it prevents fraud:**
- High-value scammers can't operate unverified
- Identity verification creates accountability
- Harder to create multiple fake accounts

#### 4. Dispute Protection
**How it works:**
- Buyer can dispute any transaction before payment release
- Admin reviews evidence from both parties
- Refund issued if buyer proves fraud/issues

**Why it prevents fraud:**
- Buyers have recourse if scammed
- Evidence requirement deters false claims
- Professional review ensures fairness

#### 5. Reputation Tracking
**How it works:**
- Every transaction rated (1-5 stars)
- Ratings visible to all users
- Bad ratings lower visibility and trust

**Why it prevents fraud:**
- Scammers can't maintain good ratings
- Buyers can avoid low-rated sellers
- Reputation has real value (encourages honesty)

## Common Scams and How We Prevent Them

### Scam #1: The "Pay Direct" Scam

**How it works:**
```
Scammer: "Hey, let's skip escrow to save fees.
          Just send KES 50,000 to my M-Pesa directly.
          I'll ship tomorrow!"

Buyer sends money → Scammer disappears
```

**How we prevent it:**
- ✓ All payments MUST go through escrow
- ✓ Users told repeatedly to never pay direct
- ✓ Accounts requesting this are banned
- ✓ No way to complete transaction outside system

**Red flags:**
- Any request for direct payment
- Promises to "avoid fees"
- Pressure to pay quickly
- Communication outside platform

### Scam #2: The Counterfeit Item

**How it works:**
```
Listing: "Authentic Nike Air Jordan 1"
Price: KES 8,000 (market: KES 25,000)
Photos: Stock photos from Nike

Buyer receives: Fake/counterfeit shoes
```

**How we prevent it:**
- ✓ Dispute system with refund protection
- ✓ Evidence review (authentication reports accepted)
- ✓ Sellers banned for selling counterfeits
- ✓ Verification helps (but not guarantee)

**Red flags:**
- Price too low
- Only stock photos
- Refuses additional photos
- "100% authentic" emphasis
- New seller, high-value items

### Scam #3: The Bait and Switch

**How it works:**
```
Listing: iPhone 13 Pro 256GB - KES 95,000
Buyer pays
Seller sends: iPhone 8 64GB

Seller claims: "Must be shipping mistake"
```

**How we prevent it:**
- ✓ Buyers confirm delivery before payment release
- ✓ Disputes resolve in buyer favor with evidence
- ✓ Sellers can't get paid without buyer confirmation
- ✓ Tracking systems catch patterns

**Red flags:**
- Stock photos only
- Vague descriptions
- Refuses video verification
- New seller account

### Scam #4: The "Never Shipped"

**How it works:**
```
Buyer pays → Seller confirms → Days pass → Nothing ships
Seller: "It's coming! Just delayed!"
Week later: "Lost in shipping!"
```

**How we prevent it:**
- ✓ Shipping deadlines (2-5 days)
- ✓ Auto-refund if not shipped on time
- ✓ Tracking numbers encouraged
- ✓ No extensions without proof

**Red flags:**
- Constant excuses for delays
- No tracking provided
- Shipping deadline approaching
- Vague responses

### Scam #5: The False Dispute (Buyer Scam)

**How it works:**
```
Buyer receives item (legitimately)
Buyer: "Item damaged/wrong/fake!"
Files dispute with fake evidence
Gets refund + keeps item
```

**How we prevent it:**
- ✓ Sellers can provide counter-evidence
- ✓ Return required for most refunds
- ✓ Admin reviews carefully
- ✓ Pattern detection for serial disputers
- ✓ Penalties for false disputes

**Red flags (for sellers):**
- Buyer has multiple past disputes
- Requests early shipping
- Communication inconsistent
- Suspicious delivery address

### Scam #6: The Overpayment Trick

**How it works:**
```
Buyer: "I accidentally paid KES 60,000 instead of KES 50,000"
Buyer: "Please refund the KES 10,000 difference"
Original payment gets reversed/was fraudulent
```

**How we prevent it:**
- ✓ Escrow holds ALL payments
- ✓ Refunds only processed by system
- ✓ Sellers can't receive overpayments
- ✓ M-Pesa validation ensures correct amounts

**This scam is impossible in our system!**

### Scam #7: The Account Takeover

**How it works:**
```
Hacker gets access to verified seller account
Posts fake listings
Collects payments (via escrow)
Never ships
```

**How we prevent it:**
- ✓ Escrow holds payments (hacker can't access immediately)
- ✓ Unusual activity triggers alerts
- ✓ Velocity checks (too many orders too fast)
- ✓ Buyers still protected with refunds

**Protect your account:**
- Use strong passwords
- Don't share login details
- Enable 2FA (if available)
- Report suspicious login attempts

### Scam #8: The Phishing Attack

**How it works:**
```
Fake message: "Your M-Pesa Escrow account needs verification"
Link: http://fake-mpesa-escr0w.com (note the 0)
Enters M-Pesa PIN → Account compromised
```

**How we prevent it:**
- ✓ We NEVER ask for PIN
- ✓ All official messages from verified bot
- ✓ Warning messages about phishing
- ✓ Education about red flags

**Protect yourself:**
- Never click suspicious links
- Verify sender is official bot
- Never share M-Pesa PIN
- Check URLs carefully
